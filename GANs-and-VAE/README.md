This repository features experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Auto-Encoders on various datasets and models. Key components include:

Fashion-MNIST : Using AutoEncoders for denoising images from Fasion-MNIST dataset.
MNIST: Testing GANs to generate and enhance handwritten digits (CNN-based).
CelebA: Applying GANs to generate artistic facial images based the CelebA dataset.
StyleGAN: Implementing NVIDIA's StyleGAN to explore advanced image generation and style transfer techniques.
