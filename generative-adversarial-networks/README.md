This repository features experiments with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) on various datasets and models. Key components include:
- MNIST: Testing GANs to generate and enhance handwritten digits (CNN-based).
- CelebA: Applying GANs to generate artistic facial images based the CelebA dataset.
- StyleGAN: Implementing NVIDIA's StyleGAN to explore advanced image generation and style transfer techniques.
