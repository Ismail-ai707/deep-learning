Welcome to this repository dedicated to exploring advanced computer vision techniques. Here, you'll find examples covering essential areas of computer vision such as:

- Object Detection: detecting multiple objects in real time using models liek YOLOv8, handling different object sizes, and improving detection accuracy.
- Face Recognition: covering various approaches for recognizing and verifying faces, including feature extraction, face embeddings, and applying state-of-the-art models for accurate face recognition.
- Transfer Learning: leveraging pre-trained models to improve performance on specific tasks with limited data.
