Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .</td>\n",

              "2      which is the most common use of opt-in e-mail marketing [SEP] Email marketing has evolved rapidly alongside the technological growth of the 21st century . Prior to this growth , when emails were novelties to the majority of customers , email marketing was not as effective . In 1978 , Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation ( DEC ) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network ( ARPANET ) . This email resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products , and highlighted the potential of marketing through mass emails . However , as email marketing developed as an effective means of direct communication , users began blocking out content from emails with filters and blocking programs . In order to effectively communicate a message through email , marketers had to develop a way of pushing content through to the end user , without being cut out by automatic filters and spam removing software . This resulted in the birth of triggered marketing emails , which are sent to specific users based on their tracked online browsing patterns .   \n",

Most of the Earth 's crust consists of solid oxides , the result of elements being oxidized by the oxygen in air or in water . Hydrocarbon combustion affords the two principal carbon oxides : carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide . Even materials considered pure elements often develop an oxide coating . For example , aluminium foil develops a thin skin of Al O ( called a passivation layer ) that protects the foil from further corrosion . Individual elements can often form multiple oxides , each containing different amounts of the element and oxygen . In some cases these are distinguished by specifying the number of atoms as in carbon monoxide and carbon dioxide , and in other cases by specifying the element 's oxidation number , as in iron ( II ) oxide and iron ( III ) oxide .

Venice , where sail - canvas was easily available , was a leader in the move to canvas . Small cabinet paintings were also made on metal , especially copper plates . These supports were more expensive but very firm , allowing intricately fine detail . Often printing plates from printmaking were reused for this purpose . The popularity of oil spread through Italy from the North , starting in Venice in the late 15th century . By 1540 , the previous method for painting on panel ( tempera ) had become all but extinct , although Italians continued to use chalk - based fresco for wall paintings , which was less successful and durable in damper northern climates .', 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

In 1754 , 22 noblemen , professors , and landowners founded the Society of St Andrews Golfers . This society would eventually become the precursor to the Royal and Ancient which is the governing body for golf everywhere outside of the United States and Mexico . St Andrews Links had a scare when they went bankrupt in 1797 . The Town Council of St. Andrews decided to allow rabbit farming on the golf course to challenge golf for popularity . Twenty years of legal battling between the golfers and rabbit farmers ended in 1821 when a local landowner and golfer named James Cheape of Strathtyrum bought the land and is credited with saving the links for golf . The course evolved without the help of any one architect for many years , though notable contributions to its design were made by Daw Anderson in the 1850s and Old Tom Morris ( 1865 -- 1908 ) , who designed the 1st and 18th holes . Originally , it was played over the same set of fairways out and back to the same holes .

Anandamath ( The Abbey of Bliss , 1882 ) is a political novel which depicts a Sannyasi ( Hindu ascetic ) army fighting the British soldiers . The book calls for the rise of Indian nationalism . The novel was also the source of the song Vande Mataram ( I worship my Motherland for she truly is my mother ) which , set to music by Rabindranath Tagore , was taken up by many Indian nationalists , and is now the National Song of India . The plot of the novel is loosely set on the Sannyasi Rebellion . He imagined untrained Sannyasi soldiers fighting and beating the highly experienced British Army ; ultimately however , he accepted that the British can not be defeated . He categorically claimed that the British are not the enemy but friends ; the Muslims are the real enemy . Hence , this novel is also termed communal in nature . The novel first appeared in serial form in Bangadarshan , the literary magazine that Chattopadhyay founded in 1872 . Vande Mataram became prominent during the Swadeshi movement , which was sparked by Lord Curzon 's attempt to partition Bengal into a Hindu majority West and a Muslim majority East . Drawing from the Shakti tradition of Bengali Hindus , Chattopadhyay personified India as a Mother goddess , which gave the song a Hindu undertone that would prove to be problematic for some Muslims .\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

As with most public changes to currency systems , there has been a great amount of seignorage of the discontinued coins . All coins portray the reigning Australian Sovereign , Queen Elizabeth II , on the obverse , and are produced by the Royal Australian Mint .\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

The pen draws ink from the reservoir through a feed to the nib and deposits it on paper via a combination of gravity and capillary action . Filling the reservoir with ink may be achieved manually , via the use of a Pasteur pipette ( eyedropper ) or syringe , or via an internal filling mechanism which creates suction ( for example , through a piston mechanism ) to transfer ink directly through the nib into the reservoir .

To fill , the barrel was unscrewed , the exposed open end of the reservoir was placed in ink and the interstices of the plastic sheet and slots initiated capillary action , drawing up and retaining the ink . The outside of the reservoir was coated with Teflon , a repellent compound that released excess ink as it was withdrawn . Ink was transferred through a further capillary tube to the nib .

After World War II , an improved form of black - and - white TV broadcasting became popular in the United States and Britain , and television sets became commonplace in homes , businesses , and institutions . During the 1950s , television was the primary medium for influencing public opinion . In the mid-1960s , color broadcasting was introduced in the US and most other developed countries . The availability of multiple types of storage media such as Betamax , VHS tape , local disks , DVDs , flash drives , high - definition Blu - ray Discs , and digital video recorders have enabled viewers to watch prerecorded material -- such as movies -- at home on their own time schedule . For many reasons , the storage of television and video programming now occurs on the cloud . At the end of the first decade of the 2000s , digital television transmissions greatly increased in popularity . Another development was the move from standard - definition television ( SDTV ) ( 576i , with 576 interlaced lines of resolution and 480i ) to high - definition television ( HDTV ) , which provides a resolution that is substantially higher .

Despite the name , it is incorrect to consider g - force a fundamental force , as `` g - force '' ( lower - case character ) is a type of acceleration that can be measured with an accelerometer . Since g - force accelerations indirectly produce weight , any g - force can be described as a `` weight per unit mass '' ( see the synonym specific weight ) . When the g - force acceleration is produced by the surface of one object being pushed by the surface of another object , the reaction force to this push produces an equal and opposite weight for every unit of an object 's mass . The types of forces involved are transmitted through objects by interior mechanical stresses .

Machine - based scoring of multiple - choice tests taken by pencil had made it possible to rapidly process the exams . The G.I. Bill produced an influx of millions of veterans into higher education . The formation of the Educational Testing Service ( ETS ) also played a significant role in the expansion of the SAT beyond the roughly fifty colleges that made up the College Board at the time . The ETS was formed in 1947 by the College Board , Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching , and the American Council on Education , to consolidate respectively the operations of the SAT , the GRE , and the achievement tests developed by Ben Wood for use with Conant 's scholarship exams . The new organization was to be philosophically grounded in the concepts of open - minded , scientific research in testing with no doctrine to sell and with an eye toward public service . The ETS was chartered after the death of Brigham , who had opposed the creation of such an entity . Brigham felt that the interests of a consolidated testing agency would be more aligned with sales or marketing than with research into the science of testing .

In order to have the SAT more closely reflect high school curricula , certain types of questions were eliminated : analogies from the verbal section and quantitative comparison items from the math section . A new writing section , with an essay , based on the former SAT II Writing Subject Test , was added , in part to increase the chances of closing the opening gap between the highest and midrange scores . Other factors included the desire to test the writing ability of each student ; hence the essay . The essay section added an additional maximum 800 points to the score , which increased the new maximum score to 2400 . The `` New SAT '' was first offered on March 12 , 2005 , after the last administration of the `` old '' SAT in January 2005 . The mathematics section was expanded to cover three years of high school mathematics .

Evolution by natural selection is a process first demonstrated by the observation that often , more offspring are produced than can possibly survive . This is followed by three observable facts about living organisms : 1 ) traits vary among individuals with respect to morphology , physiology , and behaviour ( phenotypic variation ) , 2 ) different traits confer different rates of survival and reproduction ( differential fitness ) , and 3 ) traits can be passed from generation to generation ( heritability of fitness ) .

Macroevolution refers to evolution that occurs at or above the level of species , in particular speciation and extinction ; whereas microevolution refers to smaller evolutionary changes within a species or population , in particular shifts in gene frequency and adaptation . In general , macroevolution is regarded as the outcome of long periods of microevolution . Thus , the distinction between micro - and macroevolution is not a fundamental one -- the difference is simply the time involved . However , in macroevolution , the traits of the entire species may be important . For instance , a large amount of variation among individuals allows a species to rapidly adapt to new habitats , lessening the chance of it going extinct , while a wide geographic range increases the chance of speciation , by making it more likely that part of the population will become isolated .

It has been suggested that `` the term ' sustainability ' should be viewed as humanity 's target goal of human - ecosystem equilibrium ( homeostasis ) , while ' sustainable development ' refers to the holistic approach and temporal processes that lead us to the end point of sustainability '' . The modern economies are endeavouring to reconcile ambitious economic development and obligations of preserving the natural resources and ecosystem , the two are traditionally seen as of conflicting nature . Instead of holding climate change commitments and other sustainability measures as a drug to economic development , turning and leveraging them into market opportunities will do greater good .

In Half - Blood Prince , Harry pretends to give some to Ron so that he will do well at Quidditch . Ron 's luck turns for the better , with the confidence working as a placebo .

Supplied by the Soviet Union , from late 1939 to early 1941 , in a series of campaigns and treaties , Germany conquered or controlled much of continental Europe , and formed the Axis alliance with Italy and Japan .

The war continued primarily between the European Axis powers and the coalition of the United Kingdom and the British Commonwealth , with campaigns including the North Africa and East Africa campaigns , the aerial Battle of Britain , the Blitz bombing campaign , the Balkan Campaign as well as the long - running Battle of the Atlantic . On 22 June 1941 , the European Axis powers launched an invasion of the Soviet Union , opening the largest land theatre of war in history , which trapped the major part of the Axis military forces into a war of attrition .

Each episode is based around a series of cyclical events that occur along the way during Dora 's travels , along with obstacles that she and Boots are forced to overcome or puzzles that they have to solve ( with `` assistance '' from the viewing audience ) relating to riddles , the Spanish language , or counting . Common rituals may involve Dora 's encounters with Swiper , a bipedal , anthropomorphic masked thieving fox whose theft of the possessions of others must be prevented through fourth wall - breaking interaction with the viewer . To stop Swiper , Dora must say `` Swiper no swiping '' three times . However , on occasions where Swiper steals the belongings of other people , the viewer is presented with the challenge of helping Boots and Dora locate the stolen items . Another obstacle involves encounters with another one of the program 's antagonists ; the `` Grumpy Old Troll '' dwelling beneath a bridge that Dora and Boots must cross , who challenges them with a riddle before permitting them the past that needs to be solved with the viewer 's help . Known for the constant breaking of the fourth - wall depicted in every episode , the audience is usually presented to two primary landmarks that must be passed before Dora can reach her destination , normally being challenged with games or puzzles along the way . The episode always ends with Dora successfully reaching the locale , singing the `` We Did It ! '' song with Boots in triumph .\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

As the older chondrocytes degenerate , osteoblasts ossify the remains to form new bone . In puberty increasing levels of estrogen , in both females and males , leads to increased apoptosis of chondrocytes in the epiphyseal plate .

This means a good 's demand is increased when the price of another goods is decreased . Conversely , the demand for a goods is decreased when the price of another goods is increased . If goods A and B are complements , an increase in the price of A will result in a leftward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve for B to shift in ; less of each goods will be demanded . A decrease in price of A will result in a rightward movement along the demand curve of A and cause the demand curve B to shift outward ; more of each goods will be demanded . Basically this means that since the demand of one goods is linked to the demand of another goods , if a higher quantity is demanded of one goods , a higher quantity will also be demanded of the other , and if a lower quantity is demanded of one goods , a lower quantity will be demanded of the other . The prices of complementary goods are related in the same way : if the price of one goods rises , so will the price of the other , and vice versa . With substitute goods , however , the price and quantity demanded of one goods is related inversely to the price and quantity demanded of a substitute goods , meaning that if the price or quantity demanded of one goods rises , the price or quantity demanded of its substitute will fall .\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

The Pennsylvania Dutch Convention & Visitors Bureau notes that the whoopie pie recipe comes from the area 's Amish and Pennsylvania German culture -- origins that are unlikely to leave an official paper trail -- and has been handed down through generations . Labadie 's Bakery in Lewiston , Maine has been making the confection since 1925 . The now - defunct Berwick Cake Company of Roxbury , Massachusetts was selling `` Whoopee Pies '' as early as the 1920s , but officially branded the Whoopee Pie in 1928 to great success . Various claims suggest that the whoopie pie originated in Massachusetts and spread both north and south , or that German immigrants in Pennsylvania brought the predecessor of the whoopie pie to communities throughout the northeast . A clue into how the possibly Amish dessert got to be so popular in New England can be found in a 1930s cookbook called Yummy Book by the Durkee Mower Company , the manufacturer of Marshmallow Fluff . In this New England cookbook , a recipe for `` Amish Whoopie Pie '' was featured using Marshmallow Fluff in the filling .\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 1},\n",

Their captains , who have lost contact with them , are worried sick with their disappearances until they suddenly return a day later . Rangiku and Nanao were gone only a few hours and came back directly , which concludes that the time in the Dangai is out of sync with the Soul Society . Mayuri Kurotsuchi conducts a survey of the area with Kenpachi Zaraki assisting as a security escort . Meanwhile , while Ichigo Kurosaki and Rukia Kuchiki go off to handle hollows , Kon leaves to investigate a spiritual disturbance and finds a green - haired girl lying asleep and covered in rags .

Yoruichi Shihōin arrives and seals Renji and Ikkaku before escaping with Ichigo and Rukia into her hideout . She explains to them that Renji and Ikkaku were secretly replaced by reigai , artificial bodies which allows modified souls to maintain a physical form in Soul Society . The reigai , which closely imitate the features of a Soul Reaper , are being used to test out soul candies , which means someone in the twelfth division is involved .

When the four fakes arrive in various areas , Ikkaku battles Kenpachi 's reigai , while some of the lieutenants deal with the rest , all to buy more time for Nozomi .

After witnessing Nozomi absorb an attack from his bow , Ginrei Kojaku , Uryū deduces that her zanpakutō can absorb anything with spiritual pressure . Having no other choice but to rely on her , Ichigo , Uryū , Chad and the remaining lieutenants all direct their spiritual pressure at Nozomi , which she redirects at the four false captains . Byakuya 's reigai survives the attack , but Yamamoto suddenly appears and defeats him .     333   `` Destroy Nozomi ! ? Genryusai 's Decision ! '' `` Nozomi o Kesu ! ? Genryūsai no Ketsudan !

Ukitake and Kyōraku 's reigai suddenly appear in the living world and are back for a rematch with Yamamoto , but Ichigo and Nozomi take over for now and spar with the two . Ichigo later has to cover for Nozomi when she is defeated , but even then he barely evades the attacks of Ukitake and Kyōraku 's reigai . Yamamoto , distracted at this , is soon immobilized by the Unohara 's reigai , but as the original Unohara stops her , he is able to break the seal with his spiritual pressure . When Yamamoto is about to be attacked by the three reigai , Inaba arrives and commands them to stop , as he wants to be the one to battle Yamamoto . Nozomi offers to be a decoy to prevent Inaba from copying Yamamoto 's techniques . Inaba avoids crossing swords with Nozomi , knowing full well of her abilities , but Nozomi pulls out a surprise attack , having already absorbed Yamamoto 's spiritual pressure . Yamamoto attacks Inaba with his flames , as this was a diversion for Ichigo to use his Getsuga Tenshō on Inaba . However , Ichigo collapses and Nozomi goes to catch him . Inaba , revealed to still be alive , was able to copy the abilities of Nozomi , absorbing both Yamamoto and Ichigo 's attacks . As Inaba then uses this to finish Yamamoto off , Nozomi appears before the blast in an attempt to absorb the attack .     334   `` The Depleting Reiatsu ! Ichigo , Death Struggle of the Soul !

He is seen crying out for Nozomi , while Ichigo 's uniform turns white as a result of his depleting spiritual energy .     335   `` Hiding in the Dangai ? Another Ichigo ? ! '' `` Dangai ni Senpuku ? Mō Hitori no Ichigo ! ? '' ( 断 界 に 潜伏 ? もう 一人 の 一 護 ! ? )   August 16 , 2011   March 8 , 2014     Following his defeat by Inaba , Ichigo has lost his Soul Reaper powers . Still determined to save Nozomi , Ichigo and his friends gather at the Urahara Shop to come up with a rescue plan . Urahara comes up with a risky plan that involves Ichigo going in the Dangai and being swallowed by the Kōtotsu to retrieve a sample of his Soul Reaper powers , since he was swallowed before . The plan works and Ichigo gets out of the Kōtotsu . When he meets up with everyone , he states that he saw another one of himself when he was inside the Kōtotsu , leading Urahara to conclude that Ichigo saved himself when he was first swallowed , since there is no time in the Kōtotsu .     336   `` Pursue Kageroza !

As they search for Inaba 's laboratory , Urahara makes an attempt to restore Ichigo 's lost powers by creating a soul candy , but is discovered by Nanao and Nemu 's reigai . At the last minute before an explosion , Ichigo breaks the glass containing the soul candy and consumes it . However , as stated by Urahara , the candy was incomplete , making both his Soul Reaper and hollow powers unbalanced . While escaping , the three are ambushed by the false captains , but are saved when Yoruichi and the originals appear , ready to fight .     337   `` The Developer of the Modified Souls '' `` Kaizō Konpaku no Kaihatsusha '' ( 改造 魂魄 の 開発 者 )   August 30 , 2011   March 22 , 2014     The captains , thought to have fallen in battle , return to fight the reigai . Meanwhile , Ichigo powers continue to grow unstable , forcing him to rest for the time being , while Urahara and Kon continue their investigation on Inaba . Urahara and Kon later find out about Ōko Yushima , the Soul Reaper who extracted all of his spirit particles and separating them into two modified souls , them being Nozomi and Inaba . When visiting Yushima 's cell in the Nest of Maggots , they get attacked by Suì - Fēng and Ōmaeda 's reigai , but are later defeated by Urahara . The two visit Yushima 's cell , only to find him unresponsive , leading Urahara to conclude that Yushima will never gain consciousness . Meanwhile , Ichigo 's hollowfied form finally takes over and escapes the building he was in .     338   `` Kon 's Thoughts , Nozomi 's Thoughts '' `` Kon no Omoi , Nozomi no Omoi '' ( コン の 想い 、 望実 の 想い )   September 6 , 2011   March 29 , 2014     Urahara and Kon head to the location where Inaba 's other laboratory might be , only to be halted by Urahara 's reigai . As Urahara battles his counterpart , Kon dashes down into the laboratory , where he promptly tries to awaken Nozomi inside her capsule . She does awaken and insists that Kon escape at first , but after seeing his persistence and his devotion of trying to save her , being bound by friendship , she tries to help Kon restore Ichigo 's spiritual energy . Before Ichigo 's soul candy can be created , Nemu 's reigai appears and stops the transfer . Immediately afterwards , the fusion process between Nozomi and Inaba is completed . Ichigo 's hollowfied form defeats the eighth division members , but when he is about to destroy Nanao 's reigai , the fused Yushima appears before him .     339   `` Protect Ichigo !

The captains and their reigai counterparts are finally joined by their lieutenants , who help them in the battle . Rukia , Renji , Orihime , Uryū and Chad arrive on Sōkyoku Hill and all try to stop Yushima , but the combined powers of Nozomi and Inaba prove to be too much for them . Yushima reveals the true nature of his zanpakutō , Sumitsukigasa , and defeats everyone , but before he can finish them off , Ichigo jumps in front of Rukia to take an attack that was meant for her .     340   `` Reigai vs. Original , The Fierce Fighting for Gambled Pride !

Ichigo is left to watch as his friends attempt to overpower Yushima , but Yushima finds to a way to break through whatever they try to attack him with . Yushima has Nemu 's reigai bring him more fusion stabilizer , but when she arrives , she unexpectedly kicks him backward . It is revealed that Kon was helped by Urahara and Mayuri by placing his soul candy into that of Nemu 's reigai . Kon gives Ichigo a complete soul candy , which restores his powers . He prepares to unleash his bankai against Yushima . Meanwhile , Byakuya has deduced that the reigai do not sacrifice themselves to attack the originals when they are all together , as it goes against what they believe in . The originals join forces against the reigai to protect the Soul Society .     341   `` Invading Army Arc , Final Conclusion ! '' `` Shingun Hen , Saishū Ketchaku !

With the assistance of his friends , Ichigo is able to fire a hollowfied Getsuga Tenshō , which Yushima is unable to absorb because of his inability to absorb hollow spiritual pressure . Ichigo will have to attack Yushima 's saketsu , his binding soul chain , to destroy his hakusui , the source of his powers . As Yushima strikes at Ichigo , he catches his zanpakutō and fires a huge hollowfied Getsuga Tenshō , which causes great damage to Yushima and the area . Nozomi 's consciousness appears for a moment and asks to be killed , but Yushima takes complete control and unleashes a giant structure that absorbs the spirit particles from the Soul Society . Being surrounded by his structure and Ichigo out of the way , Nozomi regains control and creates a sword to slice Yushima 's saketsu . The reigai react shockingly to Yushima 's attack and reveal that their motive was to protect the Soul Society in their own way . The reigai proceed to attack the structure at the cost of their own lives , causing a huge explosion . Ichigo deactivates his bankai and has one last clash with an enraged Yushima before breaking the fusion . Nozomi and Inaba reappear once again , and Inaba begins to question his thoughts to Nozomi before fading away . Nozomi reuinites with Kon and the rest of her friends , but she starts fades away herself . Nozomi says a heartwarming goodbye to Kon and fades away .     342   `` Thank You '' `` Arigatō '' ( ありがとう )   October 4 , 2011   April 26 , 2014     Ichigo has been struggling against hollows , due to gradually losing his temporarily restored powers , but is saved by Rukia and Uryū , who tell him to rest from dealing with hollows . It is shown that Ukitake contacted Rukia to prevent Ichigo from fighting hollows . The next day , Ichigo takes Rukia to an ice skating rink with their friends . At night , fireworks from a nearby amusement park begin to shoot up in the sky , ending the day on a happy note . A massive hollow is sensed nearby when Ichigo and Rukia are heading home , but Rukia tries to save Ichigo from facing it , telling her that she would fight in his place if she has to , seeing him as a good friend . Rukia freezes the hollow 's legs , and Ichigo fires his last Getsuga Tenshō and destroys it . An exhausted Ichigo was well aware that Rukia was instructed to prevent Ichigo from fighting hollows and to give him rest , but he knows that he will remain the same way as he has been before . Ichigo wakes up in his room , surrounded by his friends . He goes outside and takes note of his disappearing powers , unable to sense spirits anymore .

Just outside the city of Dallas , the stadium was located in Irving , Texas . The stadium opened on October 24 , 1971 , at a cost of $35 million and with a seating capacity of 65,675 . The stadium was famous for its hole - in - the - roof dome . The roof 's worn paint had become so unsightly in the early 2000s that it was repainted in the summer of 2006 by the City of Irving . It was the first time the famed roof was repainted since Texas Stadium opened . The roof was structurally independent from the stadium it covered . The Cowboys lost their final game at Texas Stadium to the Baltimore Ravens , 33 -- 24 , on December 20 , 2008 . After Cowboys Stadium was opened in 2009 , the Cowboys turned over the facility to the City of Irving .\", 'text_b': None, 'label': 0},\n",

              " \"<P> Eighty percent of the world 's supply of ascorbic acid is produced in China . Ascorbic acid is prepared in industry from glucose in a method based on the historical Reichstein process . In the first of a five - step process , glucose is catalytically hydrogenated to sorbitol , which is then oxidized by the microorganism Acetobacter suboxydans to sorbose . Only one of the six hydroxy groups is oxidized by this enzymatic reaction . From this point , two routes are available . Treatment of the product with acetone in the presence of an acid catalyst converts four of the remaining hydroxyl groups to acetals . The unprotected hydroxyl group is oxidized to the carboxylic acid by reaction with the catalytic oxidant TEMPO ( regenerated by sodium hypochlorite -- bleaching solution ) . Historically , industrial preparation via the Reichstein process used potassium permanganate as the bleaching solution . Acid - catalyzed hydrolysis of this product performs the dual function of removing the two acetal groups and ring - closing lactonization . This step yields ascorbic acid . Each of the five steps has a yield larger than 90 % . </P>\",\n",

A second genetically modified microbe species , such as mutant Erwinia , among others , oxidises sorbose into 2 - ketogluconic acid ( 2 - KGA ) , which can then undergo ring - closing lactonization via dehydration . This method is used in the predominant process used by the ascorbic acid industry in China , which supplies 80 % of world 's ascorbic acid . American and Chinese researchers are competing to engineer a mutant that can carry out a one - pot fermentation directly from glucose to 2 - KGA , bypassing both the need for a second fermentation and the need to reduce glucose to sorbitol . </P>\",\n",

It is one of the 20th century 's most famous and distinctive buildings . </P> <P> Designed by Danish architect Jørn Utzon , the building was formally opened on 20 October 1973 after a gestation beginning with Utzon 's 1957 selection as winner of an international design competition . The Government of New South Wales , led by the premier , Joseph Cahill , authorised work to begin in 1958 with Utzon directing construction . The government 's decision to build Utzon 's design is often overshadowed by circumstances that followed , including cost and scheduling overruns as well as the architect 's ultimate resignation . </P> <P> The building and its surrounds occupy the whole of Bennelong Point on Sydney Harbour , between Sydney Cove and Farm Cove , adjacent to the Sydney central business district and the Royal Botanic Gardens , and close by the Sydney Harbour Bridge . </P> <P> Though its name suggests a single venue , the building comprises multiple performance venues which together host well over 1,500 performances annually , attended by more than 1.2 million people . Performances are presented by numerous performing artists , including three resident companies : Opera Australia , the Sydney Theatre Company and the Sydney Symphony Orchestra . As one of the most popular visitor attractions in Australia , more than eight million people visit the site annually , and approximately 350,000 visitors take a guided tour of the building each year . The building is managed by the Sydney Opera House Trust , an agency of the New South Wales State Government . </P> <P> On 28 June 2007 , the Sydney Opera House became a UNESCO World Heritage Site ; having been listed on the ( now defunct ) Register of the National Estate since 1980 , the National Trust of Australia register since 1983 , the City of Sydney Heritage Inventory since 2000 , the New South Wales State Heritage Register since 2003 , and the Australian National Heritage List since 2005 . </P> <P> The facility features a modern expressionist design , with a series of large precast concrete `` shells '' , each composed of sections of a sphere of 75.2 metres ( 246 ft 8.6 in ) radius , forming the roofs of the structure , set on a monumental podium . The building covers 1.8 hectares ( 4.4 acres ) of land and is 183 m ( 600 ft ) long and 120 m ( 394 ft ) wide at its widest point . It is supported on 588 concrete piers sunk as much as 25 m ( 82 ft ) below sea level . </P> <P> Although the roof structures are commonly referred to as `` shells '' ( as in this article ) , they are precast concrete panels supported by precast concrete ribs , not shells in a strictly structural sense . Though the shells appear uniformly white from a distance , they actually feature a subtle chevron pattern composed of 1,056,006 tiles in two colours : glossy white and matte cream . The tiles were manufactured by the Swedish company Höganäs AB which generally produced stoneware tiles for the paper - mill industry . </P> <P> Apart from the tile of the shells and the glass curtain walls of the foyer spaces , the building 's exterior is largely clad with aggregate panels composed of pink granite quarried at Tarana . Significant interior surface treatments also include off - form concrete , Australian white birch plywood supplied from Wauchope in northern New South Wales , and brush box glulam . </P> <P> Of the two larger spaces , the Concert Hall is in the western group of shells , the Joan Sutherland Theatre in the eastern group . The scale of the shells was chosen to reflect the internal height requirements , with low entrance spaces , rising over the seating areas up to the high stage towers . The smaller venues ( the Drama Theatre , the Playhouse and the Studio ) are within the podium , beneath the Concert Hall . A smaller group of shells set to the western side of the Monumental Steps houses the Bennelong Restaurant . The podium is surrounded by substantial open public spaces , and the large stone - paved forecourt area with the adjacent monumental steps is regularly used as a performance space . </P> <P> The Sydney Opera House includes a number of performance venues : </P> <Ul> <Li> Concert Hall : With 2,679 seats , the home of the Sydney Symphony Orchestra and used by a large number of other concert presenters .

Venues are also used for conferences , ceremonies and social functions . </P> <P> The building also houses a recording studio , cafes , restaurants , bars and retail outlets . Guided tours are available , including a frequent tour of the front - of - house spaces , and a daily backstage tour that takes visitors backstage to see areas normally reserved for performers and crew members . </P> <P> Planning began in the late 1940s , when Eugene Goossens , the Director of the NSW State Conservatorium of Music , lobbied for a suitable venue for large theatrical productions . The normal venue for such productions , the Sydney Town Hall , was not considered large enough . By 1954 , Goossens succeeded in gaining the support of NSW Premier Joseph Cahill , who called for designs for a dedicated opera house . It was also Goossens who insisted that Bennelong Point be the site : Cahill had wanted it to be on or near Wynyard Railway Station in the northwest of the CBD . </P> <P> An international design competition was launched by Cahill on 13 September 1955 and received 233 entries , representing architects from 32 countries . The criteria specified a large hall seating 3,000 and a small hall for 1,200 people , each to be designed for different uses , including full - scale operas , orchestral and choral concerts , mass meetings , lectures , ballet performances , and other presentations . </P> <P> The winner , announced in 1957 , was Jørn Utzon , a Danish architect . According to legend the Utzon design was rescued by noted Finnish - American architect Eero Saarinen from a final cut of 30 `` rejects '' . The runner - up was an entry by firm GBQC of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . The grand prize was 5,000 Australian pounds . Utzon visited Sydney in 1957 to help supervise the project . His office moved to Palm Beach , Sydney in February 1963 . </P> <P> Utzon received the Pritzker Architecture Prize , architecture 's highest honour , in 2003 . The Pritzker Prize citation read : </P> <P> There is no doubt that the Sydney Opera House is his masterpiece . It is one of the great iconic buildings of the 20th century , an image of great beauty that has become known throughout the world -- a symbol for not only a city , but a whole country and continent . </P> <P> The Fort Macquarie Tram Depot , occupying the site at the time of these plans , was demolished in 1958 and construction began in March 1959 . It was built in three stages : stage I ( 1959 -- 1963 ) consisted of building the upper podium ; stage II ( 1963 -- 1967 ) the construction of the outer shells ; stage III ( 1967 -- 1973 ) interior design and construction . </P> <P> Stage I commenced on 2 March 1959 with the construction firm Civil & Civic , monitored by the engineers Ove Arup and Partners . The government had pushed for work to begin early , fearing that funding , or public opinion , might turn against them . However , Utzon had still not completed the final designs . Major structural issues still remained unresolved . By 23 January 1961 , work was running 47 weeks behind , mainly because of unexpected difficulties ( inclement weather , unexpected difficulty diverting stormwater , construction beginning before proper construction drawings had been prepared , changes of original contract documents ) . Work on the podium was finally completed in February 1963 . The forced early start led to significant later problems , not least of which was the fact that the podium columns were not strong enough to support the roof structure , and had to be re-built . </P> <P> The shells of the competition entry were originally of undefined geometry , but , early in the design process , the `` shells '' were perceived as a series of parabolas supported by precast concrete ribs . However , engineers Ove Arup and Partners were unable to find an acceptable solution to constructing them . The formwork for using in - situ concrete would have been prohibitively expensive , and , because there was no repetition in any of the roof forms , the construction of precast concrete for each individual section would possibly have been even more expensive . </P> <P> From 1957 to 1963 , the design team went through at least 12 iterations of the form of the shells trying to find an economically acceptable form ( including schemes with parabolas , circular ribs and ellipsoids ) before a workable solution was completed . The design work on the shells involved one of the earliest uses of computers in structural analysis , to understand the complex forces to which the shells would be subjected . The computer system was also used in the assembly of the arches . The pins in the arches were surveyed at the end of each day , and the information was entered into the computer so the next arch could be properly placed the following day . In mid-1961 , the design team found a solution to the problem : the shells all being created as sections from a sphere . This solution allows arches of varying length to be cast in a common mould , and a number of arch segments of common length to be placed adjacent to one another , to form a spherical section . With whom exactly this solution originated has been the subject of some controversy . It was originally credited to Utzon . Ove Arup 's letter to Ashworth , a member of the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee , states : `` Utzon came up with an idea of making all the shells of uniform curvature throughout in both directions . '' Peter Jones , the author of Ove Arup 's biography , states that `` the architect and his supporters alike claimed to recall the precise eureka moment ... ; the engineers and some of their associates , with equal conviction , recall discussion in both central London and at Ove 's house . '' </P> <P> He goes on to claim that `` the existing evidence shows that Arup 's canvassed several possibilities for the geometry of the shells , from parabolas to ellipsoids and spheres . '' Yuzo Mikami , a member of the design team , presents an opposite view in his book on the project , Utzon 's Sphere . It is unlikely that the truth will ever be categorically known , but there is a clear consensus that the design team worked very well indeed for the first part of the project and that Utzon , Arup , and Ronald Jenkins ( partner of Ove Arup and Partners responsible for the Opera House project ) all played a very significant part in the design development . </P> <P> As Peter Murray states in The Saga of the Sydney Opera House : </P> <P> ... the two men -- and their teams -- enjoyed a collaboration that was remarkable in its fruitfulness and , despite many traumas , was seen by most of those involved in the project as a high point of architect / engineer collaboration . </P> <P> The design of the roof was tested on scale models in wind tunnels at University of Southampton and later NPL in order to establish the wind - pressure distribution around the roof shape in very high winds , which helped in the design of the roof tiles and their fixtures . </P> <P> The shells were constructed by Hornibrook Group Pty Ltd , who were also responsible for construction in Stage III . Hornibrook manufactured the 2400 precast ribs and 4000 roof panels in an on - site factory and also developed the construction processes . The achievement of this solution avoided the need for expensive formwork construction by allowing the use of precast units ( it also allowed the roof tiles to be prefabricated in sheets on the ground , instead of being stuck on individually at height ) . Ove Arup and Partners ' site engineer supervised the construction of the shells , which used an innovative adjustable steel - trussed `` erection arch '' to support the different roofs before completion . On 6 April 1962 , it was estimated that the Opera House would be completed between August 1964 and March 1965 . </P> <P> Stage III , the interiors , started with Utzon moving his entire office to Sydney in February 1963 . However , there was a change of government in 1965 , and the new Robert Askin government declared the project under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Public Works . Due to the Ministry 's criticism of the project 's costs and time , along with their impression of Utzon 's designs being impractical , this ultimately led to his resignation in 1966 ( see below ) . </P> <P> The cost of the project so far , even in October 1966 , was still only $22.9 million , less than a quarter of the final $102 million cost . However , the projected costs for the design were at this stage much more significant . </P> <P> The second stage of construction was progressing toward completion when Utzon resigned . His position was principally taken over by Peter Hall , who became largely responsible for the interior design . Other persons appointed that same year to replace Utzon were E.H. Farmer as government architect , D.S. Littlemore and Lionel Todd . </P> <P> Following Utzon 's resignation , the acoustic advisor , Lothar Cremer , confirmed to the Sydney Opera House Executive Committee ( SOHEC ) that Utzon 's original acoustic design allowed for only 2000 seats in the main hall and further stated that increasing the number of seats to 3000 as specified in the brief would be disastrous for the acoustics . According to Peter Jones , the stage designer , Martin Carr , criticised the `` shape , height and width of the stage , the physical facilities for artists , the location of the dressing rooms , the widths of doors and lifts , and the location of lighting switchboards . '' </P> <Ul> <Li> The major hall , which was originally to be a multipurpose opera / concert hall , became solely a concert hall , called the Concert Hall . The minor hall , originally for stage productions only , incorporated opera and ballet functions and was called the Opera Theatre , later renamed the Joan Sutherland Theatre . As a result , the Joan Sutherland Theatre is inadequate to stage large - scale opera and ballet . A theatre , a cinema and a library were also added . These were later changed to two live drama theatres and a smaller theatre `` in the round '' . These now comprise the Drama Theatre , the Playhouse and the Studio respectively . These changes were primarily because of inadequacies in the original competition brief , which did not make it adequately clear how the Opera House was to be used . The layout of the interiors was changed , and the stage machinery , already designed and fitted inside the major hall , was pulled out and largely thrown away , as detailed in the 1968 BBC TV documentary Autopsy on a Dream , which `` chronicles the full spectrum of controversy surrounding the construction of the Sydney Opera House '' . </Li> <Li> Externally , the cladding to the podium and the paving ( the podium was originally not to be clad down to the water , but to be left open ) . </Li> <Li> The construction of the glass walls ( Utzon was planning to use a system of prefabricated plywood mullions , but a different system was designed to deal with the glass ) . </Li> <Li> Utzon 's plywood corridor designs , and his acoustic and seating designs for the interior of both major halls , were scrapped completely . His design for the Concert Hall was rejected as it only seated 2000 , which was considered insufficient . Utzon employed the acoustic consultant Lothar Cremer , and his designs for the major halls were later modelled and found to be very good . The subsequent Todd , Hall and Littlemore versions of both major halls have some problems with acoustics , particularly for the performing musicians . The orchestra pit in the Joan Sutherland Theatre is cramped and dangerous to musicians ' hearing . The Concert Hall has a very high roof , leading to a lack of early reflections onstage -- perspex rings ( the `` acoustic clouds '' ) hanging over the stage were added shortly before opening in an ( unsuccessful ) attempt to address this problem . </Li> </Ul> <Li> The major hall , which was originally to be a multipurpose opera / concert hall , became solely a concert hall , called the Concert Hall .

H.R. `` Sam '' Hoare , the Hornibrook director in charge of the project , provided the following approximations in 1973 : Stage I : podium Civil & Civic Pty Ltd approximately $5.5 m . Stage II : roof shells M.R. Hornibrook ( NSW ) Pty Ltd approximately $12.5 m . Stage III : completion The Hornibrook Group $56.5 m . Separate contracts : stage equipment , stage lighting and organ $9.0 m . Fees and other costs : $16.5 m . </P> <P> The original cost and scheduling estimates in 1957 projected a cost of £ 3,500,000 ( $7 million ) and completion date of 26 January 1963 ( Australia Day ) . In reality , the project was completed ten years late and 1,357 % over budget in real terms . </P> <P> Before the Sydney Opera House competition , Jørn Utzon had won seven of the 18 competitions he had entered but had never seen any of his designs built . Utzon 's submitted concept for the Sydney Opera House was almost universally admired and considered groundbreaking . The Assessors Report of January 1957 , stated : </P> <P> The drawings submitted for this scheme are simple to the point of being diagrammatic . Nevertheless , as we have returned again and again to the study of these drawings , we are convinced that they present a concept of an Opera House which is capable of becoming one of the great buildings of the world . </P> <P> For the first stage , Utzon worked successfully with the rest of the design team and the client , but , as the project progressed , the Cahill government insisted on progressive revisions . They also did not fully appreciate the costs or work involved in design and construction . Tensions between the client and the design team grew further when an early start to construction was demanded despite an incomplete design . This resulted in a continuing series of delays and setbacks while various technical engineering issues were being refined . The building was unique , and the problems with the design issues and cost increases were exacerbated by commencement of work before the completion of the final plans . </P> <P> After the 1965 election of the Liberal Party , with Robert Askin becoming Premier of New South Wales , the relationship of client , architect , engineers and contractors became increasingly tense . Askin had been a `` vocal critic of the project prior to gaining office . '' His new Minister for Public Works , Davis Hughes , was even less sympathetic . Elizabeth Farrelly , an Australian architecture critic , wrote that : </P> <P> at an election night dinner party in Mosman , Hughes ' daughter Sue Burgoyne boasted that her father would soon sack Utzon . Hughes had no interest in art , architecture or aesthetics . A fraud , as well as a philistine , he had been exposed before Parliament and dumped as Country Party leader for 19 years of falsely claiming a university degree . The Opera House gave Hughes a second chance . For him , as for Utzon , it was all about control ; about the triumph of homegrown mediocrity over foreign genius . </P> <P> Differences ensued . One of the first was that Utzon believed the clients should receive information on all aspects of the design and construction through his practice , while the clients wanted a system ( notably drawn in sketch form by Davis Hughes ) where architect , contractors , and engineers each reported to the client directly and separately . This had great implications for procurement methods and cost control , with Utzon wishing to negotiate contracts with chosen suppliers ( such as Ralph Symonds for the plywood interiors ) and the New South Wales government insisting contracts be put out to tender . </P> <P> Utzon was highly reluctant to respond to questions or criticism from the client 's Sydney Opera House Executive Committee ( SOHEC ) . However , he was greatly supported throughout by a member of the committee and one of the original competition judges , Harry Ingham Ashworth . Utzon was unwilling to compromise on some aspects of his designs that the clients wanted to change . </P> <P> Utzon 's ability was never in doubt , despite questions raised by Davis Hughes , who attempted to portray Utzon as an impractical dreamer . Ove Arup actually stated that Utzon was `` probably the best of any I have come across in my long experience of working with architects '' and : `` The Opera House could become the world 's foremost contemporary masterpiece if Utzon is given his head . '' </P> <P> In October 1965 , Utzon gave Hughes a schedule setting out the completion dates of parts of his work for stage III . Utzon was at this time working closely with Ralph Symonds , a manufacturer of plywood based in Sydney and highly regarded by many , despite an Arup engineer warning that Ralph Symonds 's `` knowledge of the design stresses of plywood , was extremely sketchy '' and that the technical advice was `` elementary to say the least and completely useless for our purposes . '' Australian architecture critic Elizabeth Farrelly has referred to Ove Arup 's project engineer Michael Lewis as having `` other agendas '' . In any case , Hughes shortly after withheld permission for the construction of plywood prototypes for the interiors , and the relationship between Utzon and the client never recovered . By February 1966 , Utzon was owed more than $100,000 in fees . Hughes then withheld funding so that Utzon could not even pay his own staff . The government minutes record that following several threats of resignation , Utzon finally stated to Davis Hughes : `` If you do n't do it , I resign . '' Hughes replied : `` I accept your resignation . Thank you very much . Goodbye . '' </P> <P> Utzon left the project on 28 February 1966 . He said that Hughes 's refusal to pay him any fees and the lack of collaboration caused his resignation and later famously described the situation as `` Malice in Blunderland '' . In March 1966 , Hughes offered him a subordinate role as `` design architect '' under a panel of executive architects , without any supervisory powers over the House 's construction , but Utzon rejected this . Utzon left the country never to return . </P> <P> Following the resignation , there was great controversy about who was in the right and who was in the wrong . The Sydney Morning Herald initially opined : `` No architect in the world has enjoyed greater freedom than Mr Utzon . Few clients have been more patient or more generous than the people and the Government of NSW . One would not like history to record that this partnership was brought to an end by a fit of temper on the one side or by a fit of meanness on the other . '' On 17 March 1966 , the Herald offered the view that : `` It was not his ( Utzon 's ) fault that a succession of Governments and the Opera House Trust should so signally have failed to impose any control or order on the project ... his concept was so daring that he himself could solve its problems only step by step ... his insistence on perfection led him to alter his design as he went along . '' </P> <P> The Sydney Opera House opened the way for the immensely complex geometries of some modern architecture . The design was one of the first examples of the use of computer - aided design to design complex shapes . The design techniques developed by Utzon and Arup for the Sydney Opera House have been further developed and are now used for architecture , such as works of Gehry and blobitecture , as well as most reinforced concrete structures . The design is also one of the first in the world to use araldite to glue the precast structural elements together and proved the concept for future use . </P> <P> It was also a first in mechanical engineering . Another Danish firm , Steensen Varming , was responsible for designing the new air - conditioning plant , the largest in Australia at the time , supplying over 600,000 cubic feet ( 17,000 m ) of air per minute , using the innovative idea of harnessing the harbour water to create a water - cooled heat pump system that is still in operation today . </P> <P> After the resignation of Utzon , the Minister for Public Works , Davis Hughes , and the Government Architect , Ted Farmer , organised a team to bring the Sydney Opera House to completion . The architectural work was divided between three appointees who became the Hall , Todd , Littlemore partnership . David Littlemore would manage construction supervision , Lionel Todd contract documentation , while the crucial role of design became the responsibility of Peter Hall . </P> <P> Peter Hall ( 1931 -- 1995 ) completed a combined arts and architecture degree at Sydney University . Upon graduation a travel scholarship enabled him to spend twelve months in Europe during which time he visited Utzon in Hellebæk . Returning to Sydney , Hall worked for the Government Architect , a branch of the NSW Public Works Department . While there he established himself as a talented design architect with a number of court and university buildings , including the Goldstein Hall at the University of New South Wales , which won the Sir John Sulman Medal in 1964 . </P> <P> Hall resigned from the Government Architects office in early 1966 to pursue his own practice . When approached to take on the design role , ( after at least two prominent Sydney architects had declined ) , Hall spoke with Utzon by phone before accepting the position . Utzon reportedly told Hall : he ( Hall ) would not be able to finish the job and the Government would have to invite him back . Hall also sought the advice of others , including architect Don Gazzard who warned him acceptance would be a bad career move as the project would `` never be his own '' . </P> <P> Hall agreed to accept the role on the condition there was no possibility of Utzon returning . Even so , his appointment did not go down well with many of his fellow architects who considered that no one but Utzon should complete the Sydney Opera House . Upon Utzon 's dismissal , a rally of protest had marched to Bennelong Point . A petition was also circulated , including in the Government Architects office . Peter Hall was one of the many who had signed the petition that called for Utzon 's reinstatement . </P> <P> When Hall agreed to the design role and was appointed in April 1966 , he imagined he would find the design and documentation for the Stage III well advanced . What he found was an enormous amount of work ahead of him with many aspects completely unresolved by Utzon in relation to seating capacity , acoustics and structure . In addition Hall found the project had proceeded for nine years without the development of a concise client brief . To bring himself up to speed , Hall investigated concert and opera venues overseas and engaged stage consultant Ben Schlange and acoustic consultant Wilhelm Jordan , while establishing his team . In consultation with all the potential building users the first Review of Program was completed in January 1967 . The most significant conclusion reached by Hall was that concert and opera were incompatible in the same hall . Although Utzon had sketched ideas using plywood for the great enclosing glass walls , their structural viability was unresolved when Hall took on the design role . With the ability to delegate tasks and effectively coordinate the work of consultants , Hall guided the project for over five years until the opening day in 1973 . </P> <P> A former Government Architect , Peter Webber , in his book Peter Hall : the Phantom of the Opera House , concludes : when Utzon resigned no one was better qualified ( than Hall ) to rise to the challenge of completing the design of the Opera House . </P> <P> The Sydney Opera House was formally opened by Elizabeth II , Queen of Australia , on 20 October 1973 . A large crowd attended . Utzon was not invited to the ceremony , nor was his name mentioned . The opening was televised and included fireworks and a performance of Beethoven 's Symphony No. 9 . </P> <P> During the construction phase , lunchtime performances were often arranged for the workers , with American vocalist Paul Robeson the first artist to perform , in 1960 . </P> <P> Various performances were presented prior to the official opening : </P> <Ul> <Li> The first solo piano recital was in the Concert Hall on 10 April 1973 , played by Romola Costantino to an invited audience . </Li> <Li> The first opera performed was Sergei Prokofiev 's War and Peace , in what was then known as the Opera Theatre on 28 September 1973 , conducted by the Australian Opera 's Music Director , Edward Downes .

Rites of Passage was premiered almost exactly a year later , on 27 September 1974 . ) </Li> <Li> The first evening performance of an opera was Larry Sitsky 's The Fall of the House of Usher , conducted by Rex Hobcroft and paired with Dalgerie by James Penberthy , to a libretto by Mary Durack ; it took place on 25 July 1973 . </Li> <Li> The first public concert in the Concert Hall took place on 29 September 1973 .

In 1999 , he was appointed by the Trust as a design consultant for future work . </P> <P> In 2004 , the first interior space rebuilt to an Utzon design was opened , and renamed `` The Utzon Room '' in his honour . It contains an original Utzon tapestry ( 14.00 x 3.70 metres ) called Homage to Carl Philipp Emmanuel Bach . In April 2007 , he proposed a major reconstruction of the Opera Theatre , as it was then known . Utzon died on 29 November 2008 . </P> <P> A state memorial service , attended by Utzon 's son Jan and daughter Lin , celebrating his creative genius , was held in the Concert Hall on 25 March 2009 featuring performances , readings and recollections from prominent figures in the Australian performing arts scene . </P> <P> Refurbished Western Foyer and Accessibility improvements were commissioned on 17 November 2009 , the largest building project completed since Utzon was re-engaged in 1999 . Designed by Utzon and his son Jan , the project provided improved ticketing , toilet and cloaking facilities . New escalators and a public lift enabled enhanced access for the disabled and families with prams . The prominent paralympian athlete Louise Sauvage was announced as the building 's `` accessibility ambassador '' to advise on further improvements to aid people with disabilities . </P> <P> On 29 March 2016 , an original 1959 tapestry by Le Corbusier ( 2.18 x 3.55 metres ) , commissioned by Utzon to be hung in the Sydney Opera House and called Les Dés Sont Jetés ( The Dice Are Cast ) , was finally unveiled in situ after being owned by the Utzon family and held at their home in Denmark for over 50 years . The tapestry was bought at auction by the Sydney Opera House in June 2015 . It now hangs in the building 's Western Foyer and is accessible to the public . </P> <P> In the second half of 2017 , the Joan Sutherland Theatre was closed to replace the stage machinery and for other works . The Concert Hall is scheduled for work in 2020 - 2021 . </P> <P> In 1993 , Constantine Koukias was commissioned by the Sydney Opera House Trust in association with REM Theatre to compose Icon , a large - scale music theatre piece for the 20th anniversary of the Sydney Opera House </P> <P> During the 2000 Summer Olympics , the venue served as the focal point for the triathlon events . The event had a 1.5 km ( 0.9 mi ) swimming loop at Farm Cove , along with competitions in the neighbouring Royal Botanical Gardens for the cycling and running portions of the event . </P> <P> Since 2013 , a group of residents from the nearby Bennelong Apartments ( better known as ' The Toaster ' ) , calling themselves the Sydney Opera House Concerned Citizens Group , have been campaigning against Forecourt Concerts on the grounds that they exceed noise levels outlined in the development approval ( DA ) . In February 2017 the NSW Department of Planning and the Environment handed down a $15,000 fine to the Sydney Opera House for breach of allowed noise levels at a concert held in November 2015 . However the DA was amended in 2016 to allow an increase in noise levels in the forecourt by 5 decibels . The residents opposing the concerts contend that a new DA should have been filed rather than an amendment . </P> <P> The Sydney Opera House sails formed a graphic projection - screen in a lightshow mounted in connection with the International Fleet Review in Sydney Harbour on 5 October 2013 . </P> <P> On 31 December 2013 , the venue 's 40th anniversary year , a New Year firework display was mounted for the first time in a decade . The Sydney Opera House hosted an event , ' the biggest blind date ' on Friday 21 February 2014 that won an historic Guinness World Record . The longest continuous serving employee was commemorated on June 27th 2018 , for 50 years of service . </P> <P> On 5 October 2018 the Opera House chief executive Louise Herron clashed with Sydney radio commentator Alan Jones who called for her sacking for refusing to allow Racing NSW to use the Opera House sails to advertise The Everest horse race . Within hours , NSW Premier Gladys Berejiklian overruled Herron . Two days later , Prime Minister Scott Morrison supported the decision , calling the Opera House `` the biggest billboard Sydney has '' . The NSW Labor party leader , Luke Foley , and senior federal Labor frontbencher Anthony Albanese have supported the proposal . The political view is not supported by significant public opinion , with a petition against the advertising collecting over 298,000 names by 9 October 2018 . 235,000 printed petition documents were presented to the NSW parliament in the morning . A survey conducted on 8 October by market research firm Micromex found that 81 % of those surveyed were not supportive of the premier 's direction . </P> <Table> <Tr> <Td> </Td> <Td> This section needs additional citations for verification .
