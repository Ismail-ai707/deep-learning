Welcome to the Generative AI repository, where you'll find a collection of projects focused on leveraging transformers and attention mechanisms for advanced AI applications. 
This repository explores the power of large language models (LLMs) and their capabilities in various generative tasks.

Projects Included:
- Question Answering: Develop and refine models that can accurately answer questions based on given context or documents.
- Text Generation: Implement and experiment with models to generate coherent and contextually relevant text.
- Text Summarization: Create models that condense long documents into concise summaries while retaining key information.
- Translation: Build and test models for translating text between different languages using transformer-based architectures.
- Text Classification: Work on classifying text into categories, such as sentiment analysis or topic classification.
- Named Entity Recognition (NER): Identify and classify entities (e.g., names, dates, locations) in text.
