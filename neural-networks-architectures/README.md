This repository contains a collection of tutorials focused on evaluating various neural network architectures. You will find examples for testing the following architectures:
- Multilayer Perceptrons (MLP - Advanced): foundational model for a wide range of tasks.
- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN): highly effective for image-related tasks and spatial data.
- Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN): highly effective for sequence data, including time-series and natural language processing.
